                <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
                    world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
                    know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
                    five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed
                    the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

                <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
                    to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
                    more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred
